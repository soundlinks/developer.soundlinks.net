# Build applications on Soundlinks

We know that it's difficult for an individual to release the potential of Soundlinks. So we provide SDK and API for communities in order to make Soundlinks be integrated with more applications. The more songs which have Soundlinks in, the easier it is to verify music copyrights online & offline and carry on commercial authorization.

- Try SDK and API now, please read "[Start here](/en/introduction/)"
- If you want to feedback issues or suggestions, please click "Contact" on the top
- To get more details and updates for Soundlinks, please visit our [official website](https://soundlinks.net)
