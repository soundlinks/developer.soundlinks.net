# Start here

## Prerequisite

Every developer needs to be reviewed by us, after that, you will get `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` to use our service. Please send email to [dev@soundlinks.net](mailto:dev@soundlinks.net) for the request.

## Recognizing Soundlinks

For mobile phones, we provide iOS and Android SDK to recognize Soundlinks via microphones. After 3rd-party APP integrates with the SDK, it has capability to recognize Soundlinks in a song for its both copyright information and media links set by the song owner.

## Creating Soundlinks

To create a new song with Soundlinks, you can request "[Start encoding API](/en/api/#start-encoding)".

::: tip Note

The open API is a simplified version of Soundlinks encoding service. You cannot set media links of a song by API or use [Soundchains](https://soundchains.net) blockchains. If you want the full version, please [sign up Soundlinks account](https://soundlinks.net/songs) and apply to be one of our musicians.
